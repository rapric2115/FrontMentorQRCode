## Overview

I have some knowledge developing web sites so replicating this QR Code Project was quiet easy just add few elements and css classes.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.



**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

 So what i did first was read all the documentation, the style guide and looked all file. At the Beginner I was thinking replicate this project using React but I decide to do it with HTML and CSS only, so what i did first was create a style.css file and connected to index.html, so I change the body background to light gray, them make a div container for the QR and make the background completely white and adjust the width and height as decide.

 The next step was the QR image, I place the image in the center of the QR container put then a borders radius, the an H2 heading elements and a paragraph styled as I saw it in the design provided.

 In Summary replicating this design wasn't so hard a all, just want to know from 1 to 10 how much you think I'll get.

### Built with

### What I learned

What I learn is how to use correctly flexbox, and center elements using flex and align items, content, self. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
